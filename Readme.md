## 📚 Features

### ✔️ Role-Based Prompting

Tell ChatGPT *who to act as* for better, more accurate responses.

Examples:

* “Act as an Azure Architect…”
* “Act as a PowerShell expert…”
* “Act as a cybersecurity auditor…”

---

### ✔️ Output Formatting Control

Force ChatGPT to respond exactly how you want:

* Bullet points
* Tables
* Step-by-step procedures
* Ready-to-send emails
* Copy/paste PowerShell scripts

---

### ✔️ Multiple Response Variants

Create multiple versions so you can choose:

* Short vs. long
* Professional vs. casual
* Summary vs. detailed
* Option A / B / C

---

### ✔️ Iterative Improvement

After an answer, ask:

* “Make it shorter.”
* “Add diagrams.”
* “Increase detail by 10×.”
* “Improve readability.”

ChatGPT refines the output like a real editor.

---

### ✔️ Error Checking & Review

You can paste any:

* Script
* Firewall config
* Policy
* Architecture plan

Then ask ChatGPT to review, debug, or optimize it.

---

### ✔️ Step-By-Step Mode

Great for troubleshooting or learning:

* “Explain step-by-step how this works.”
* “Break down the logic.”

This gives clarity and deeper understanding.

---

### ✔️ “What Am I Missing?” Prompting

Add blind-spot detection by asking:

* “What else should I consider?”
* “What are the risks?”
* “What would a senior architect think of this?”

---

### ✔️ Best Practices + Common Mistakes

Ask:

> “Give me best practices AND the most common mistakes.”

This doubles the value of the answer.
